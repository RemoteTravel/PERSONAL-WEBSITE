Hello, and welcome to my personal website via Github or somewhere else!

My name is Danny Street. I am currently a senior studying at UMass Amherst in Massachusetts, USA. I enjoy web development, hence why I have started this personal website that will showcase my skills.

This is a fresh start for my online presence, and I'm excited to build something that reflects who I am and what I do. While it's still under development, I'm eager to share my current plans and future aspirations for this site.

Upcoming Additions:

    About Me
    Resume: I'm working on crafting a concise and compelling resume to showcase my skills and experience. Stay tuned for its arrival!
    Blog: This section will be my playground for sharing thoughts, ideas, and projects on topics that inspire me. Whether it's coding adventures, creative explorations, or just musings on life, I hope you'll find something interesting to read and engage with.
